# Comparing two health conditions with CellChat
### This directory contains the scripts used for comparing two different health conditions.

To compare two Seurat Objects with two different health conditions with each other, run "Run.R"
For this, two Seurat objects need to be in the working directory, and are loaded in lines 14 and 15. 


- This script is based on an original CellChat tutorial, which can be visited from https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat/blob/master/tutorial/Comparison_analysis_of_multiple_datasets.html
